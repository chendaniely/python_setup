We'll be using `pyenv` to install Python.

First, we need to know what version of Python you want to install.
Luckily, `pyenv` can list out all the versions available to you by typing

```sh
pyenv install --list
```

Usually you know roughly some version of Python you may already want to intsall,
but not the exact number.
You can filter the results with a match

::: {.panel-tabset}

## MacOS / Linux / Git Bash

```sh
pyenv install --list | grep 3.11
```

## Windows Powershell

```powershell
 pyenv install --list | select-string 3.11
```

:::

This will list all the Python 3.11 patch versions for you.

If you want to install the latest Python version,
you only need to spcify the major number, `3`.

```sh
pyenv install 3
```

You can list all the `pyenv` installed verstions with:

```sh
pyenv versions
```
